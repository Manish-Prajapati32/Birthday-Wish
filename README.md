## 🤡 What Is This Madness?

**Birthday-Wish** is a fun, animated birthday website designed to:
- Overreact 🎉  
- Over-animate 💃  
- Over-embarrass 😈  

Instead of texting “HBD bro”, send this and **force them to smile** (or cringe).

---

## 🎭 Why You Should Use This

- 🎂 Cake without calories  
- 🎉 Party without expenses  
- 😈 Roast without consequences  
- 📱 Works on phone, laptop, fridge (almost)

Basically, maximum drama with minimum effort.

---

## 🚀 Features (Totally Serious)

- 🎆 Flashy birthday animations
- 🧍 Personalized name so they feel special (for 10 seconds)
- 📱 Mobile-friendly (because everyone stalks on phone)
- ⚡ No frameworks, no headache, no excuses
- 🌍 Runs in browser, not in your imagination

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack (No Rocket Science)
